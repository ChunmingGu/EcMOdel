# EcMOdel

## Our goal is to develop a machine learning prediction algorithm for neurological injury in pediatric cardiac patients.

### The biggest risk factor for Pediatric EcMo patients is stroke.  We have built a framework to statistically assess actionable events leading to stroke and improve neurological outcomes.  


## How to use
### * Required Library
 - Python 3.6
 - Keras
 
### Installing from Github

https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/EcMOdel.git

Add raw data into '/data' folder.

Run 'main.ipynb' to train/test model.

Final results are saved in '/results' folder.
